# How to Contribute

Thanks for helping develop libxas! Your contributions are always wanted.

### 1. Understand GPL 2.0

What you can do with libxas - and what others can do with your contribution - is
specified in the GNU General Public License, version 2.0. This is available
in the file "LICENSE". Please read this before you contribute.

### 2. Make a fork and open a Draft Pull Request

To fork, press the "fork" button. You then want to head to pull requests and create
a new one requesting your fork be pulled into `main`. While your PR is still in
development, please set it as a draft. This allows others to know that the
intention of your fork is to be merged, but doesn't pollute the general PR pool.
Once you're ready, you can make it a normal PR. 

### 3. Write and Commit Your Code

Now's the time for you to make your changes. When you commit them, please make
sure to use the signage conventions from the 
[Linux Kernel Project](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html).
An absolute requirement for non-maintainers (and still preferred for maintainers)
is the `Signed-off-by` line, as it is your signature that you have the right to submit the
code. 

### 4. Await Review

We may ask you to make changes. If so, and they are made, we'll be happy to merge!
Thank you for contributing.
